Move Mmessages or Yourself thunderbird plugin
This is a simple plugin for Thunderbird which enables you to move messages to a folder, choosing the particular folder from a filtered listbox. You can also use it jump to the folder only, of move and jump and the same time. It is on the Thunderbird listing also (https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/move-messages/)

It was built starting from the 'hello world' example. I found it usefull having al lot (>200) mail and a lot of mailfolders to manage during a working day. Other plugins exists which can do similar, but have a lot more options, or are not free. I like to keep it simple and free.

Please feel free to use the code, change it, or to submit fixes.
