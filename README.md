Move Messages or Yourself thunderbird plugin. 
This is a simple plugin for Thunderbird which enables you to move messages to a folder, choosing the particular folder from a filtered listbox which is opened with a keystroke. You can also use it to jump to the folder only, or move and jump and the same time. It is on the Thunderbird [listing](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/move-messages/).

I found it usefull having al lot (>200) mail and a lot of mailfolders to manage during a working day. Other plugins exists which can do similar, but have a lot more options, or are not free. I like to keep it simple and free.

Defaults:
* Ctrl+Shift+Z: move a message
* Ctrl+Shift+X: jump to folder
* Ctrl+Shift+A: move a message and jump to the same folder

These shortcut keys can be changed using the "Manage Extension Shortcuts" panel in Thunderbird which can be accessed via the Tools menu, choose "Add-ons and Themes", in this panel click on the wheel to the right. The popup then shows the option "Manage Extension Shortcuts".

Please feel free to use the code, change it, or to submit bux fixes.
